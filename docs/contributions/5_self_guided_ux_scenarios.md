# Self-Guided UX Scenarios

This guide is a walkthrough of some of the core areas of the BetterVoting.com experience.

This guide can be used in a "playtesting" session, where a team member can take notes while the user shares their screen, but it can also be used by a new team member to learn more about the tool and identify the areas of friction for themselves. Having new team members is particularly helpful since they still have a fresh perspective on the project.

## Recording (Recommended)

It helps to have these session recorded. Then team members can look back at any areas of friction as they improve the platform.

If you're recording, start off by sharing the following. This helps contextulaize the playtest for anyone viewing the recording.

 * What is your prior knowledge with STAR Voting and voting reform in general?
 * Do you have previous experience with web development or anything web adjacent?

## General Instructions

 * If you find bugs please report them using the feedback widget in the bottom corner (or if you're a team member developer, this is a good opportunity to practice writing issues in GitHub)
 * Viewers of the session (if present) will mostly be silent
 * Please vocalize your thoughts as much as possible
 * If you have questions please ask those as well (the viewers might not answer them, but it's good to know any questions you may have)
 * The scenario instructions are intentionally vague in order to better test if these features are discoverable through the website
 * Each scenario will end with a video this is a sample of what the scenario is expected to look like.

Proceed to execute the following scenarios to the best of your ability.

## Scenario #1: Voting in an open poll

Your friend just shared a poll with you: bettervoting.com/meta_pets . Give it a try!

## Scenario #2: Creating a basic poll

Now you'd like to try making a poll of your own. Do the following:

<input type="checkbox"> Navigate to BetterVoting.com

<input type="checkbox"> Create a quick poll for "What's your favorite fruit" (or whatever you like)

<input type="checkbox"> Then find the sharable link and share it with the viewer (if present)

## Scenario #3 - 1: Creating a advanced election

Your town is hosting an election, and your city clerk asks you to create an election on bettervoting.com . Here’s their specifications:

<input type="checkbox"> There are two races, 1 for mayor, and 1 for a high speed rail ballot initiative.

<input type="checkbox"> The mayor race should use star voting.

<input type="checkbox"> The ballot initiative should use Choose One and only have options for Yes and No in response to “Should we spend 1 billion dollars to add high speed rail in our town?”.

<input type="checkbox"> Only registered voters can vote in this election.

<input type="checkbox"> The election should start on the first day of the following month (ex. January 1st 2025).

<input type="checkbox"> The options on each ballot should be randomized.

### Mayor Candidates

| Names |  Campaign Website |
|-|-|
| Carlie Conservative | https://www.gop.gov/ |
| Danny Democrat | https://democrats.org/ |
| Gary Green | https://katieporter.com/ | 

### Registered Voters

| Emails |
|-|
| *your email* |
| arendpeter+ux@equal.vote |

### Final steps

<input type="checkbox"> You cast a test ballot as a final check.

<input type="checkbox"> Finalize the election

<input type="checkbox"> Draft an email to all registered voters inviting them to vote

## Scenario #3 - 2: Voting from an email invite

Now you're assuming the role of a voter.

You've just received a ballot in your inbox. Vote in the election (and thank you for being civically engaged!!)

## The End

That's the end of the user scenarios! Be sure to report any feedback or comments from the process.
