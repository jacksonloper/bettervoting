## Using Loki/Grafana

Loki: This is a service for backing up logs. This ensures that old logs are still available even when the server crashes.

Grafana: This is the web end point for viewing those logs, and it's what you'll interact with at 

# Grafana example queries

Open the Hamburger Menu then click Explore to enter queries.


You can use code mode to run some of the example queries:

**Show all logs for the star-server backend**

```
{pod=~"star-server-app-.*"}
```

**Find all 500 Errors**

```
{pod=~"star-server-app-.*"} |~ "status:50.+"
```

**Trace a specific API request**

NOTE: For a specific api request, I recommend switching from the default sorting to newest first

```
{pod=~"star-server-app-.*"} |~ "ctx:c09a38fc"
```

**500 Errors w/o robots.txt**

```
{pod=~"star-server-app-.*"} |~ "status:50.+" != "robots.txt"
```

**Query Discord Logs**

```
{pod=~"discord-bot-app-.*"}
```
