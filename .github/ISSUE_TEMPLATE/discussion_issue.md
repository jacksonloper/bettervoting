# NOTE: DON'T CHANGE THIS TO A FORM
#  I tried changing this to a form, but it was tricky since the form doesn't let you set a default title, and input field doesn't support autocomplete (for issue and user links). The other benefit of markdown is the temporary question can function as both a checkbox, and an opportunity to add more context. Overall the form ended up being super long and hurt more than it helped. Below is my form attempt in case the sitation changes later.
